# Cables Sous-marins

This is a group project undertaken at Polytech Sorbonne University studying the generation of random variables.

### Repository structure

- `Rcpp` contains test scripts used to get a feel for integrating C/C++ functions and calling them from R. I explore how to use `pthreads` and other parallel toolboxes to optimize execution speeds
- `advanced_r` contains some notes taken from Hadley Wickham's advanced r textbook
- `monte_carlo_methods` contains well actually nothing right now :(
- `r_scripts` contains functions/scripts that arenÂ´t mature enough to make it into the base sousmarin package
- `resources` contains various pdfs to help us along with our research
- `shiny` contains a template for a shiny app
- `sousmarin` is the actual R package
- `tex` contains the necessary .tex files to compile our pdf report
